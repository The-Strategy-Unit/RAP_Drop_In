# RAP_Drop_In

This repo is being set up to host questions and answers featured at The Strategy Unit RAP Drop In sessions, which are hosted by the [Data Science team](https://the-strategy-unit.github.io/data_science/), and to provide a space for discussion and pre-emptive question asking.

## How to interact with us

### How to submit a question for the next session

1.  Click on the 'Discussions' button at the top of the repository's main page.
2.  Click the 'Q&A' button.
3.  Enter the text of your question and click 'Start Discussion'. If your query is specific to something in your code, consider sharing a **rep**roducible **ex**ample. There is a package that can help called [{reprex}](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/). Doing this will likely lead to a faster, better answer.
4.  We will pick up these questions and try to answer them at the next RAP Drop In session, and will add the answers to the discussion, so that you can find the answer here if you miss a session.

Please also interact by:
  -  Upvoting answers you think are useful
  -  Marking the accepted answer using 'Mark as answer'
  -  Upvoting new discussions if you also want them to be answered at the next session.

See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/participating-in-a-discussion) for further guidance on GitHub Discussions.
